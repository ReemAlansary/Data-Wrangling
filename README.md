# Data-Wrangling
Data wrangling project performed in line with data analysis nanodegree on Udacity

- This is a data wrangling project that was carried out entirely in one jupyter notebook with the 3 wrangling sections *(Gather, Assess, Clean)* clearly outlined.
- This project was also augmented with a data visualization section as an integral part.

*The data used in this project was obtained from Twitter in part using its API. Starting information was available as files.*

In the *Assess* section, the data was visually and programmatically assessed to identify quality and tidiness issues. These issues were documented and resolved in the *Clean* section. The resulting clean data was then used to generate visualizations and derive insights.
